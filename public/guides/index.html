            <h1>Master ARC Raiders</h1>
            <p>Your Essential Guide Hub for conquering the extraction shooter.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Core gameplay explained: A Raider's Journey</h2>
        <p>ARC Raiders is a high-stakes extraction shooter where every raid presents both opportunity and peril. Understanding the core gameplay loop is foundational to your success.</p>

        <h3>Preparation in Speranza:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning & Pre-Deployment:</strong> Within Speranza, research quests, consult faction vendors (The Tribe, Speranza Survivors, The Commune), and prepare your optimal loadout based on your intended raid's map and difficulty.</li>
            <li><strong>Hideout Management:</strong> Invest time crafting, managing resources, upgrading modules, and progressing your character's skills. Strategic Hideout usage is a raider's backbone.</li>
            <li><strong>Loadout Selection:</strong> Choose between risk-free standard loadouts (no Safe pocket) or your personally curated gear (with a precious single Safe pocket slot for loot insurance).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Raid Deployment & On-Surface Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extraction Shooter Fundamentals:</strong> Deploy onto your selected map. Balance PvE encounters against ARC enemies, dynamic PvP threats from other Raiders, and focused objective completion (quests, loot zones, contracts, points of interest).</li>
            <li><strong>Risk vs. Reward Decision-Making:</strong> Continuously assess your loot's value, your current health/shield status, and your proximity to extraction points. Should you push for more gear or play it safe?</li>
            <li><strong>The Safe pocket Strategy:</strong> If using personal gear, whatever you place in your single Safe pocket slot is secured even if you're eliminated. Use this for blueprints, critical quest items, or high-value loot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Extraction & Safe Return:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successful Extraction:</strong> Reaching a designated extraction point and safely departing ensures all your collected loot and quest progress is secured.</li>
            <li><strong>Death & Loot Consequences:</strong> Elimination means the loss of all unextracted gear (except the single Safe pocket item on personal runs). Risk management is paramount.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-Raid in Speranza:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Loot Organization & Crafting:</strong> Sort your extracted loot, use blueprints and materials for crafting new weapons, armor, and utilities, and sell excess items for resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Hideout Progression:</strong> Upgrade your Hideout with the resources earned, unlocking improved crafting stations, new storage, and passive benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Tree Advancement:</strong> Apply earned XP or points into your three skill trees (Survival, Mobility, Conditioning), persistently strengthening your Raider for subsequent raids.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beginner Raider Essentials</h2>

        <h3>Your First 10 Raids: A Survival Guide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with Free Loadouts & Low-Risk Maps:</strong> Use standard loadouts on "Dam Battlegrounds" to learn mechanics without fearing permanent gear loss. Master movement, aiming, basic ARC enemy behavior, and extraction point locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Knowledge over Loot Initially:</strong> Your early goal is understanding the core loop, map layouts, enemy spawn patterns, and general game flow. Dying with beginner loot is expected and part of learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Tutorial & Early Quests:</strong> Follow the initial quest chains carefully. These offer structured introductions to core systems (crafting, safe pocket, skill tree access, faction interactions).</li>
            <li><strong>Hideout Focus â€“ Unlock Key Modules Early:</strong> Prioritize unlocking and upgrading the Workbench and Storage modules first. This expands your crafting options and inventory management, immediately improving efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Ammo & Weapon Compatibility:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the different ammo types (Light, Medium, Heavy) and which weapons use them. Running out of ammo mid-fight is a critical and avoidable mistake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core Mechanics Primer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stamina Management:</strong> Sprinting, climbing, and melee drain stamina. Going over-encumbered drastically slows regeneration. Skills in the Conditioning tree significantly improve stamina parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Shield vs. Health:</strong> Your shield recharges over time, while health requires bandages or medical utilities. Prioritize shield preservation.</li>
            <li><strong>ARC Enemy Basics:</strong> ARC machines have distinct behaviors. Some are highly mobile scouts, others are heavily armored tanks. Target weak points and use terrain effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Sound & Stealth Awareness:</strong> Gunfire and movement are audible to other Raiders and ARC enemies. Playing stealthily can provide critical advantages in PvP engagements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intermediate to Advanced Tactics</h2>

        <h3>Loadout Optimization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Loadout Design:</strong> Tailor your weapons and utilities to your intended playstyle. Are you a mid-range skirmisher, a close-quarters aggressive raider, or a long-range, stealthy looter?</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Offensive & Defensive Utilities:</strong> Carry healing items, shield rechargers, and at least one offensive gadget (grenades, traps, or utility items). Overloading on offense leaves you vulnerable.</li>
            <li><strong>Weapon Modding & Customization:</strong> Invest in mods for your primary weapons (scopes, silencers, stability improvements). Mods can drastically alter weapon viability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skill Tree Synergy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobility + Survival for Aggressive Play:</strong> Speed and durability allow for aggressive flanks and rapid repositioning after combat.</li>
            <li><strong>Conditioning + Survival for Heavy Loot Runs:</strong> Maximize stamina and carrying capacity for high-value extraction runs where you intend to loot extensively before extracting.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced Builds for Solo Play:</strong> Solo Raiders benefit from a balance across all three trees, ensuring they can adapt to various encounter types without squad support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Map Mastery & Strategic Awareness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memorize Extraction Points:</strong> Know at least 2-3 extraction routes for every map. If one is contested or compromised, you need backup options immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify High-Value Loot Zones:</strong> Map certain areas for consistent rare item spawns, quest locations, or crafting blueprint spawns. Efficient raiders know where to go.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Time-Limited Maps (Spaceport, Buried City):</strong> These high-risk, high-reward environments rotate availability. When active, plan specific runs to capitalize on their unique loot tables.</li>
            <li><strong>Vertical Gameplay Advantage:</strong> Use verticality (climbing, rooftops, overlooks) to scout for enemies, plan ambushes, and avoid direct confrontation when disadvantaged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PvP Engagement Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Always Assume You're Being Watched:</strong> Other Raiders are opportunistic. Stay alert, especially near high-loot zones and extraction points.</li>
            <li><strong>Disengage When Necessary:</strong> There's no shame in retreating. If you're outgunned or outnumbered, repositioning or escaping is often smarter than a losing fight.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Audio Cues Offensively:</strong> If you hear another Raider's gunfire, use that information to flank or ambush while they're engaged with ARC enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Extraction Point Ambushes are Common:</strong> Be extremely cautious as you approach extraction zones. Scout first, throw grenades into potential hiding spots, and be prepared for combat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solo Extraction Strategy: The 5-Minute Rule</h2>
        <p><strong>Why Solo is Better for Farming Loot:</strong> Here's something I learned through actual gameplayâ€”if you're focused on extracting and looting efficiently, go solo. The matchmaking tends to put solo players against other solos, which means everyone's less organized. When you queue as a 3-person team, you'll face other coordinated 3-person squads, which is great for PVP battles but significantly harder when you just want to loot and leave safely.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Extraction Point Timers</h3>
        <p>Every map has multiple extraction points, and each one operates on a timer. Here's the critical part most guides don't tell you: these extraction points close permanently based on their individual timers. When the last extraction point's timer runs out, the entire map wipes and everyone still on it dies. No exceptions.</p>

        <h3>The 5-Minute Extraction Strategy</h3>
        <p>This is the strategy that kept me alive during countless raids. <strong>Plan to be at your chosen extraction point 5 minutes before it closes.</strong> Not at the extraction point, but <em>plan your route</em> so you arrive with that buffer.</p>

        <p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p>
        <p>You're mid-raid, and two extraction points remain open:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extraction Point A:</strong> 10 minutes remaining</li>
            <li><strong>Extraction Point B:</strong> 2 minutes remaining</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're close to Extraction Point B, use itâ€”but here's the key: you should have <em>planned for this</em> 5 minutes earlier. When Point B had 7 minutes left, you should have already been heading toward it while looting along the way.</p>

        <h3>Why This Works (And Why Most Players Get It Wrong)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less Extraction Point Fights:</strong> Most players panic and rush to extractions at the last second. By extracting earlier, you avoid the chaos of desperate last-minute extractors and campers waiting for them.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Wait Until the End:</strong> The closer an extraction point gets to closing, the more dangerous it becomes. Everyone converges on the remaining options.</li>
            <li><strong>Extract Before the Second-to-Last Closes:</strong> I always aimed to extract a couple minutes before the second available extraction point closes. This is the sweet spotâ€”early enough to avoid crowds, but you've had time to loot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Fast Loot Loop Strategy</h3>
        <p>Most server instances run for 30 minutes. I regularly did 5-10 minute runs and survived almost every time. Here's the flow:</p>
        
        <ol style="margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Spawn in</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Immediately identify which extraction point will close first</strong> (check timers)</li>
            <li><strong>Plot a route toward that extraction point</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Loot everything along the way</strong> - but keep moving toward extraction</li>
            <li><strong>Extract 5 minutes before it closes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Rinse and repeat</strong> with your fresh loot secured</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Don't Overload Your Inventory:</strong> You're not staying for the full 30 minutes, so you don't need to carry everything. Take high-value items, stay mobile, and get out. Multiple safe 10-minute runs beat one risky 30-minute run where you die and lose everything.</p>

        <h3>When to Switch to PVP Mode</h3>
        <p>Once you've built up a stockpile of weapons and resources you can afford to lose, <em>then</em> start pushing for high-value loot locations and PVP engagements. But early on? Play it safe. Extract early. Build your arsenal. The PVP will still be there when you're ready.</p>

        <h2>Event Strategies & Faction Contracts</h2>
        <p>ARC Raiders features dynamic events, limited-time challenges, and faction-specific contracts that offer lucrative rewards but demand specific strategies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event-Driven Map Rotations:</strong> Stay informed about which maps and event modifiers are active. Events often boost specific loot types or introduce unique environmental challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Faction Reputation Matters:</strong> The Tribe, Speranza Survivors, and The Commune offer unique quests and vendor items. Prioritize one faction early to unlock higher-tier rewards faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Timed Contracts â€“ Efficiency is Key:</strong> Some quests have time limits or performance requirements. Plan your route and loadout accordingly before deployment.</li>
        </ul>
