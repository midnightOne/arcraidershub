        <h1>Master ARC Raiders: Your Essential Guide Hub</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome, Raider! This hub provides foundational knowledge and advanced strategies to help you survive the unforgiving world of ARC Raiders. Whether you're a new recruit or a seasoned veteran, our guides are designed to enhance your gameplay and secure your loot.</p>

        <h2>Core gameplay explained: A Raider's Journey (For Extraction Shooter Beginners)</h2>

        <h3>Preparation in Speranza:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gear Up:</strong> Strategically choose your weapons, shields, and utilities (bandages, shield rechargers).</li>
            <li><strong>Free Loadout:</strong> Opt for a risk-free run with basic gear at no cost. Ideal for learning maps, but remember, no Safe Box here!</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Gear & Safe Box:</strong> Bring your own trusted gear to gain a crucial Safe Box slot. Items placed here are secured, even if you fall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploration on the Surface:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Looting:</strong> Scavenge for crafting components, ammo, healing items, new weapons, and valuables.</li>
            <li><strong>Enemies (PvE):</strong> Battle the formidable ARC machines, from agile Ticks and aerial Snitch drones to the colossal Queen. Defeating them yields components and ARC power cells for shield recharges.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Raiders (PvP):</strong> Play solo, duo, or trio (max 3). Other players are your greatest unpredictable threat; exercise extreme caution. Proximity chat can lead to uneasy alliances or brutal ambushes.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Utilize zip lines and the snap hook for quick traversal. Remember, running without your weapon drawn increases speed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Crucial Extraction:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> To keep your hard-earned loot, you must successfully extract.</li>
            <li><strong>Alarm:</strong> Calling for extraction is a loud, public declaration, alerting both ARC machines and nearby Raiders.</li>
            <li><strong>Survive the Wait:</strong> You must hold your ground until your extraction vehicle arrives and safely departs.</li>
            <li><strong>Downed Extraction:</strong> A unique feature allows you to initiate and complete extraction even in a downed state, crawling to safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Event Guide: The Harvester (High-Risk, High-Reward)</h2>

        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Harvester is a critical, high-stakes event guarded by the Queen, involving dangerous fire and electrical hazards. Success hinges on precise timing.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Locate and Infiltrate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Find It:</strong> Spot the "Harvester" marker on your main map.</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth Over Combat:</strong> The Queen guards the Harvester; you don't need to defeat her. Wait for her patrol to shift, then discreetly approach one of the three entrance doors to breach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Master the Hazard Cycle:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fire Hazard:</strong> The entire room periodically fills with deadly flames.</li>
            <li><strong>Timing is Everything:</strong> Wait outside until the fire cycle completes. Your safe window begins immediately after the flames dissipate. Listen for audio cues warning of the fire's return, signaling you to retreat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3 (Phase 1): Power Cell Installation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retrieve Cells:</strong> Three Power Cells are found in breachable containers on the upper platform within the room.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Position:</strong> Crucially, before the safe window, place all three Power Cells near their ground nodes to minimize movement during the active phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Installation (Rapid Sequence):</strong> During the safe window, for each node: press the button to raise the housing, insert a Power Cell, then press the button again to retract.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrical Hazard:</strong> After the first cell, an electrical field drains shields. Back away to regenerate shields before proceeding to the next node.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4 (Phase 2): Destroy Yellow Buttons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target Acquisition:</strong> Nine yellow buttons emerge from the walls. Destroy them with weapons or melee.</li>
            <li><strong>Disruption:</strong> The Harvester emits pulse charges that disrupt reloads. Stay focused and keep firing.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Play:</strong> Solo players may need to exit and reset the fire cycle. Teams should assign buttons for efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Collect Loot and Extract:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Completion:</strong> All panel lines on the center console turn green.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Press the three interaction buttons (same as Phase 1) to reveal three loot canisters, often containing high-value items like Legendary Blueprints.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Loot:</strong> Immediately place any valuable blueprints into your Safe Pocket for guaranteed extraction.</li>
        </ul>
