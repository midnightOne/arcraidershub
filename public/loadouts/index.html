            <h1>Battle-Tested Loadouts</h1>
            <p>Budget-friendly weapon combos and gear strategies from actual raids. Learn what works, what doesn't, and how to stay in the fight without going broke.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Essential Loadout Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Carefully select your primary and secondary firearms based on your preferred engagement range and target types.</li>
            <li><strong>Shields:</strong> Don't forget to buy or craft a shield rechargerâ€”this is critical because <strong>shields don't regenerate on their own</strong> in ARC Raiders. You need to actively recharge them. <em>Pro tip:</em> If you find ARC Powercells topside during a raid, you can actually use them to top up your shield the same way. Just put them into your quick-use slot and "use" them like you would a shield recharger.</li>
            <li><strong>Bandages:</strong> Neverâ€”and I mean <em>never</em>â€”go out without bandages. They're crafted from 5 cloth each and have a stack size of 5. Here's the inventory optimization trick: if you have enough cloth, always craft 5 bandages at once. Why? Because whether you craft 1 bandage or 5, they still occupy one inventory slot. Might as well max out that stack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Loadout Types</h2>

        <h3>Free Loadouts</h3>
        <p>Available for risk-free runs, providing basic gear at no cost. Ideal for exploring new maps without fear of losing valuable personal items. <strong>Note:</strong> Free Loadouts do not include a safe pocket.</p>

        <h3>Personal Gear & safe pocket</h3>
        <p>When you bring your own equipped gear, you gain access to a single safe pocket slot. Any item placed here is saved, even if you are eliminated during the raid, making it vital for securing rare blueprints or high-value loot.</p>

        <h2>Proven Budget Loadouts</h2>

        <div class="loadout-card">
            <h3>ðŸ’° The "Ferro+Stitcher" Combo (Dirt Cheap Meta)</h3>
            <p><strong>Why This Works:</strong> This is <em>the</em> classic budget loadout that every serious Raider should know. It's cheap to craft, effective in combat, and even if you lose everything, Scrappyâ€”your trusty roosterâ€”will bring you more materials after each raid to craft it again.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Crafting Requirements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ferro:</strong> 3x Metal Parts, 5x Rubber Parts</li>
                <li><strong>Stitcher:</strong> 6x Metal Parts, 7x Rubber Parts</li>
                <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> 9x Metal Parts, 12x Rubber Parts (abundant materials you'll never run out of)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The Combat Flow:</strong></p>
            <p>Here's how you actually use this loadout in a fight. The Ferro hits hardâ€”really hard. We're talking 3 shots to kill a player wearing a light shield. But here's the catch: you have to reload after <em>every single shot</em>. That's where the Stitcher comes in.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Engagement Strategy:</strong></p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li><strong>Open with Ferro:</strong> Land that first precise shot for massive damage. If you're accurate, you've already won half the fight.</li>
                <li><strong>Swap to Stitcher:</strong> Instead of standing there reloading the Ferro, immediately switch to your Stitcher and finish them off with full-auto fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Reload Ferro during downtime:</strong> Between engagements, reload your Ferro so it's ready for the next opener.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>The Downsides (And How to Work Around Them):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weapon switch time:</strong> There's a delay when swapping weapons. Practice the timing so you can swap smoothly without getting caught.</li>
                <li><strong>You'll still need to reload Ferro:</strong> Don't forget to top off that Ferro between fights. Nothing worse than engaging with an empty Ferro.</li>
                <li><strong>Close-quarters can be tricky:</strong> If someone rushes you, skip the Ferro entirely and go straight Stitcher. Save the Ferro for when you have distance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why Raiders Love It:</strong> This combo is popular because it's <em>forgiving</em>. Lose a fight? No big deal. Craft another set with the materials Scrappy brings back. The Ferro teaches you precision, the Stitcher saves you when you miss, and together they cover most combat scenarios without breaking the bank.</p>

        <div class="loadout-card">
            <h3>ðŸ”¨ The "Anvil Precision" (Solo Hard-Hitter)</h3>
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A single-weapon loadout for players with deadly aim. The Anvil hand cannon delivers massive per-shot damage, perfect for ambushes and long-range picks.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key Weapon: Anvil (Hand Cannon)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Very effective against ARC armor plating and players</li>
                <li><strong>Ammo Type:</strong> Heavy Ammo (6 rounds per magazine)</li>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Patient players who can land headshots consistently</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> The Anvil is all about making every shot count. Position yourself carefully, take your time, and eliminate targets before they know where you are. Pair with bandages and a light shield to stay mobile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="loadout-card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a 0%, #2a1a1a 100%); border-left: 4px solid #c83a3a;">
            <h3>ðŸ”¨ The Hammer - Your Secret Third Weapon</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's What Nobody Tells You:</strong> You <em>always</em> have a hammer equipped in your third weapon slot. You can't unequip it, and honestly? Most people completely forget it exists until they're panicking in a firefight.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Primary Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breaching:</strong> Break open crates and doors during raids</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Melee:</strong> When you're out of ammo or caught in close quarters</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why It's Actually Broken (In a Good Way):</strong></p>
            <p>During playtesting, I kept forgetting about the hammerâ€”until I didn't. Here's what makes it crazy: it deals <strong>very high damage</strong> in close combat, way more than you'd expect from a "utility tool." But the <em>real</em> secret? <strong>It's AOE.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Picture this: you're in tight quarters, two enemies rush you, you're frantically reloadingâ€”forget the reload. Pull out the hammer. Every swing hits <strong>both</strong> of them if they're standing close together. You're literally cleaving through multiple targets per swing.</p>

            <p><strong>The Trade-Off:</strong></p>
            <p>Each hammer swing drains your stamina, so you can't just spam it endlessly. But when your back's against the wall, when you've burned through all your ammo, or when someone rushes you during a reloadâ€”the hammer wins fights that guns can't.</p>

            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't think of the hammer as a last resort. Think of it as a legitimate close-quarters option. Enemy pushed up too close? Instead of trying to hip-fire and missing, one hammer swing does more damage anyway. Just watch that stamina bar.</p>
